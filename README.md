# Chinpokomon
A Pok√©mon clone. 

This was the first proper Java project I ever did. It's a bit of a mess, but I still had a lot of fun making it. 
The project is dead right now, and it is not finished. This is because I lost all the artwork when swtiching from 
Windows to Linux, and I haven't gotten around to reviving the game and making new artwork yet.
